# How to contribute

This list was designed for the development industry of Fort Wayne. Its primary goal is to help with jobs, furthering education, and betterment of the community and local industry. Add whatever it is that you would like to the README.md. You can fork the repo and edit locally, or simply use Github's built-in editor.

In a lot of cases, it makes sense to alphabetize the items. If a list is already in alphabetical order, please add new items in alphabetical order as well. Generally speaking, try to follow any existing formatting.

We want to showcase our local developers and put emphasis on what they do and further their professional development!  When contributing a product, if it is for-profit, we ask that you simply list your company's website.  We value that your product did come from Fort Wayne; however, we want to make this a developer-enriching forum.

When adding a new section to this AWESOME list, please make sure to add it to the Table of Contents. This will keep things tidy and easy to sort.

We ask that you kindly keep the list as readable and concise as possible.  If you have a website, we expect that website provides clear and apparent information about the section you have added it to.  If you have multiple locations, we expect that your website should explain that in specificity.  Please only submit one link per organization in any given sub-section.
